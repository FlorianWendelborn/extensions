# Network Service Toggler

This extension allows you to quickly disable, enable, or automatically toggle macOS Network Services.

It can be useful when you have an issue with your network adapter and need to quickly turn it off and on again, or if you just want to disable some network services from time to time.

## I’m Getting an Error / Use Sudo

Some versions of macOS may require to use admin permissions (`sudo`) to enable or disable network services.

If this doesn’t work for you, you should attempt this:

1. Open Raycast Preferences
2. Click on “Extensions”
3. Search for “Network Service Toggler”
4. Enable “Use Sudo”
5. Go back into the raycast, close network service toggler, and re-try

⚠️ If enabling/disabling network services works without sudo, it is highly recommended to leave this turned off
